\begin{abstract}
  % This paper presents a unified framework for modeling and analyzing
  % concurrent probabilistic systems. We introduce a simpler semantics
  % for PRISM, enhancing its usability. Additionally, we define a
  % choreographic language with syntax and semantics tailored for
  % intuitive modeling. We establish the correctness of a projection
  % function translating choreographic models to PRISM-compatible
  % formats. Finally, we develop a compiler enabling seamless
  % translation of choreographic models to PRISM, facilitating
  % powerful analysis while maintaining expressive clarity. These
  % contributions bridge the gap between high-level modeling and
  % robust analysis in probabilistic systems.

  We present a choreographic framework for modelling and analysing
  concurrent probabilistic systems based on the PRISM
  model-checker. This is achieved through the development of a
  choreography language, that is a specification language that allows
  to describe the desired interactions within a concurrent system from
  a global viewpoint. Employing choreographies provides a clear and
  comprehensive view of system interactions, enabling the discernment
  of process flow and detection of potential errors, thus ensuring
  accurate execution and enhancing system reliability. We equip our
  language with a probabilistic semantics and then define a formal
  encoding into the PRISM language and discuss its
  correctness. Properties of programs written in our choreographic
  language can be model-checked by the PRISM model-checker via their
  translation into the PRISM language.  Finally, we implement a
  compiler for our language and demonstrate its practical
  applicability via examples drawn from the use cases featured on the
  PRISM website.
