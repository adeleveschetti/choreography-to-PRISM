Our next task is to provide a mapping that can translate
choreographies into the PRISM language. This section addresses
projection formally.

\mypar{Mapping Choreographies to PRISM.}  The operation of generating
endpoint code from a choreography is known as {\em
  projection}. 
% Normally, projection is defined separately for each module appearing
% in the choreography program.
We observe that to simulate a choreography interaction in
PRISM, we need to use labels on which each involved module can
synchronise. Therefore, without loss of generality, we make a slight
abuse of notation and assume that each interaction in a choreography
is annotated with a unique label (which will be used by the
projection). We call such a choreography an {\em annotated
  choreography}. 

  \begin{definition}[Annotated Choreography]
    An \emph{annotated choreography} is a choreography where each interaction is explicitly labeled with a unique identifier. Formally, an annotated choreography extends the standard choreography syntax by associating each interaction with a label that will be used during projection.
  
    Given a choreography \( C \), its annotated version \( C' \) is obtained by systematically assigning a unique label to each interaction. This ensures that every interaction can be distinctly referenced in the corresponding endpoint projection.
  \end{definition}  

For example, the choreography
$\interactBase{p}{q} +\ \lambda_1: \CEnd \ +\ \lambda_2: \ifTE
  {E}{p}{\CEnd}{\CEnd}$ is going to be annotated as
  $\interactBasel{p}{a}{q} +\ \lambda_1: \CEnd \ +\ \lambda_2: \ifTEl
    {E}{}{p}{\CEnd}{\CEnd}$.
% %
% \MC{We need to say that we must run some standard static checks
% because, since there is branching, some terms may not be
% projectable.}
% %
We now separate the definition of projection based on whether we
are dealing with rates or probabilities.  We start with choreographies 
with rates: 
% can then define the projection of a choreography with rates into the
% PRISM language.
% 
\begin{definition}[Projection, CTMC]\label{def:projCTMC} Given an
  annotated choreography with rates $C$, a module $\role p$, and a
  natural number $\iota$, we define the function $\proj$ as:
  \begin{displaymath}\small

          \proj (\role q,\interactl{p}{a}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n}, \iota)=

        \end{array}
      \end{displaymath}
    \end{definition}
    We go through the various cases of the definition above. The first
    three cases handle the projection of an interaction. If we project
    the first module $\role p$, then we create one command per branch,
    assigning the corresponding rate. Note that this is possible since
    we are dealing with rates. The additional variable $s_{\role q}$
    is the counter for this module and we identify uniquely this
    interaction. In order to do it consistently for follow up
    statements of the subterm choreographies, we use the function
    $\mathsf{nodes}(C)$ which returns the number of nodes of $C$,
    i.e., the number of steps of the projection function. Obviously,
    when projecting the next branch we need to consider all other
    possible branches that may have been already
    projected. Intuitively, a label and an integer (ranged by $\iota$)
    identify a node in the abstract syntax tree of a
    choreography. Also, note that we assume that from a label $a$ we
    can generate distinct sublabels $a_j$ just by adding some index
    $j$. For the sake of space, we do not define the function
    precisely, but we observe that this could also be easily defined
    via the label annotations. The second case defines the projection
    of an interaction for one of the modules
    $\{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n\}$. Similarly to the previous case,
    we define a command for each branch of the interaction. However,
    the rate of each command is going to be $1$, making sure that each
    branch synchronises with probability $\lambda_j*1$ (see rule
    $\mathsf{(P_2)}$ in Figure~\ref{fig:semantics}).
    %
    The third case is the one when we are projecting a module that is
    not in the set $\{\role p, \role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n\}$. % Our
    % projection takes a standard approach that requires each branch to
    % project the same~\cite{HYC16}. A generalisation of this, which may
    % require a merging operation~\cite{CHY12} and perhaps a more
    % intrinsic treatment of rates and probabilities, is left as future
    % work.
    % 
    % \marco{BEST TO COMMENT ON SELF-INTERACTION HERE and RELATED TO
    %   PROJECTION: The paper does nor require the usual condition of
    %   non-self-interaction (as evident in Listing 1.4). Additionally,
    %   clarification is needed on how projection works in cases where
    %   non-self-interaction is not enforced. Are the projection rules
    %   ordered? }
    The if-then-else construct is only interesting for module
    $\role p$ where the module makes an internal choice based on the
    evaluation of the guard $E$. % As in the previous case, the
    % other modules must project the same in $C_1$ and $C_2$.
    For recursive calls, we generate a command that resets the counter
    to a distinct value given by the auxiliary function
    $\textsf{defs}$. 
    %As an example, we can apply the projection
    %function to Example~\ref{example2} and obtain the PRISM modules
    %from Example~\ref{example3}.

\begin{example}\label{example-proj}
  In order to show how our projection works, consider the following example in which we apply the projection to Example~\ref{example2} and obtain the PRISM modules
  from Example~\ref{example3}.
  
  In Example \ref{example2} we defined a recursive choreography in which role \(\role{p}\) interacts with role \(\role{q}\) through two branches. Recall that each branch of the choreography is annotated with a unique label (e.g. \(a\) for the first branch and \(b\) for the second) and that the state of each module is tracked by a counter (e.g. \(s_{\role p}\) and \(s_{\role q}\)). 
  When applying our projection rules, the following steps occur:\\
 \textbf{Computing the States:} 
 Starting from an initial counter value of \( s_{\role{p}} = 0 \) and \( s_{\role{q}} = 0 \), we apply our projection function to determine the new state values for each interaction. The auxiliary function \(\mathsf{nodes}(C)\) counts the steps within each branch of the choreography. Since each branch in Example \ref{example2} consists of a single interaction followed by a recursive call to \(C\), we can compute the state updates as follows:
 
 For the \(j^{\text{th}}\) branch, the new state is given by:
 \[
 \iota + 1 + \sum_{k=1}^{j-1} \mathsf{nodes}(C_k)
 \]
 
 Applying this formula to our example:
 \begin{enumerate}
\item Branch \(\lambda_1\) (label \(a\)):  
\begin{itemize}
\item The initial state is \( s_{\role{p}} = 0 \) and \( s_{\role{q}} = 0 \).
\item Since \(\mathsf{nodes}(C_1) = 1\) (one interaction before the recursive call), we compute:
      \[
      s'_{\role{p}} = 0 + 1 = 1, \quad s'_{\role{q}} = 0 + 1 = 1
      \]
\item The update rule for this branch is:  
      \[
      s_{\role{p}}' = 1, \quad s_{\role{q}}' = 1
      \]
\end{itemize}
 \item Branch \(\lambda_2\) (label \(b\)):  
 \begin{itemize}
\item Again, starting from \( s_{\role{p}} = 0 \) and \( s_{\role{q}} = 0 \).
\item Since \(\mathsf{nodes}(C_2) = 1\), we compute:
      \[
      s'_{\role{p}} = 0 + 2 = 2, \quad s'_{\role{q}} = 0 + 2 = 2
      \]
\item The update rule for this branch is:  
      \[
      s_{\role{p}}' = 2, \quad s_{\role{q}}' = 2
      \]
 \end{itemize}
 \end{enumerate}
 Thus, each branch gets a unique state assigned to ensure that only one transition can be taken at a time in the PRISM model. The recursive nature of the choreography ensures that the state counters return to 0 after completing each interaction, allowing the process to repeat.\\ 
\textbf{Assigning Unique Labels:}
     For each branch, a unique label is generated from the interaction’s base label. For example, the first branch is assigned label \(a\) and the second \(b\). These labels serve as synchronization points between the interacting modules. In our projection, role \(\role{p}\) (the initiator) uses the corresponding rates (e.g. \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\) for branches 1 and 2) while role \(\role{q}\) uses a fixed rate (1) for synchronization.\\
\textbf{From Choreography to PRISM:} 
     As detailed in Example \ref{example3}, the projected PRISM network is obtained by creating commands for each branch in both roles. Each command is guarded by a condition on the state counter (for instance, \(s_{\role p}=0\) for the first branch) and includes the update that sets the counter to the new state computed above. The modules for \(\role{p}\) and \(\role{q}\) synchronize on the unique labels \(a\) and \(b\), and the overall system’s global transitions (e.g. \(F_1\) and \(F_2\)) are derived by the composition of these synchronized commands. The rates of these transitions are computed as the product of the individual rates (i.e., \(\lambda_i = \mu_i * \gamma_i\)).

\end{example}

    As hinted above, the projection in Definition~\ref{def:projCTMC}
    would be incorrect if instead of using rates we used
    probabilities. This is simply because we cannot force both
    $\role p$ and $\{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n\}$ to take the same
    branch with the probability distribution of the $\lambda_i$'s. To
    fix this problem, we have the following definition instead:
    % 
    \begin{definition}[Projection, DTMC]\label{def:projDTMC} Given an annotated
      choreography with probabilities $C$, a module $\role p$, and a
      natural number $\iota$, we define $\proj$ as:
      \begin{displaymath}\small
        \begin{array}{lr}

          \proj (\role q,\interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n}, \iota)= 
          &  \boxed{\text{if }\role q=\role p}\\[2mm]
          \qquad
          \left\{
          \begin{array}{lll}
            \commandBase {} {s_{q}\!=\! \iota}{\ \sum_{j\in J} \lambda_j: s'_{q}\!=\! \iota+1+j},\\ 
            \{\commandBase {l_j} {s_{q}\!=\! \iota+1+j}
            \ 1: s'_{q}\!=\! \iota+1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k})\ \&\ \projE
            {u_j}q\}_{j\in J}
          \end{array}
          \right\}
          \\
          \qquad\cup\ \bigcup_{j} \proj (\role q, C_j, s+1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k}))
          \\\\

        \end{array}
      \end{displaymath}
      The other cases of the definition are equivalent to those in
      Definition \ref{def:projCTMC}.
    \end{definition}
    The fix is immediate: module $\role p$ takes a (probabilistic)
    internal decision on the $j^{\text{th}}$ branch and then
    synchronises on label $l_j$ with $\{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n\}$.       

\smallskip

\mypar{Correctness.} Our projection operations are correct with
respect to the semantics of choreographies and PRISM. In the sequel,
$S_+$ is a state $S$ extended with the extra variables $s_{\role q}$
(for each module in a choreography) used by the projection. In the
projection, we utilize alphabetized parallel composition $\pp$,
wherein modules synchronise solely on labels that appear in both
modules.
% Moreover, we say that a choreography is {\em well-formed} if the
% behaviour in each branching for modules who do not participate to
% the interaction is identical.
Additionally, we use the notion of {\em strongly connected} choreography, defined as follows:

\begin{definition}[Strongly Connected Choreography]
  A choreography is said to be \emph{strongly connected} if it satisfies the following conditions:
  \begin{enumerate}
      \item Each interaction shares at least one module with the subsequent interaction~\cite{CHY12}.
      \item In every branch of a probabilistic choice or an if-then-else involving modules $\role p_1, \ldots, \role p_n$, the first action (if any) of every other module $\role q$ must be an interaction with one of $\role p_1, \ldots, \role p_n$, possibly after unfolding recursive calls.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

%a choreography is {\em strongly connected},  
%
%if (i) subsequent interactions share some modules~\cite{CHY12} and,
%
%(ii) in every branch of a probabilistic choice or an if-then-else
%involving modules $\role p_1, \ldots, \role p_n$, the fist action (if
%any) of every other module $\role q$ must be an interaction with
%$\role p_1, \ldots, \role p_n$ (up to unfolding of recursive
%calls). 
%

For example, the choreography
\begin{displaymath}\small
  X\stackrel{\mathsf{def}}{=} 
  \interactBase{p}{q}:\,
  \left(
    \begin{array}{l}
      \lambda_1: u_1;\ \interactBase{q}{r}:\, \lambda_1':u_1';\ X    \\
      \lambda_2: u_2;\ X
    \end{array}
  \right)
\end{displaymath}
%
is strongly connected while 
% 
$%  X\stackrel{\mathsf{def}}{=} 
\interactBase{p}{q}:\,
\left(
  \begin{array}{l}
    \lambda_1: u_1;\ \interactBase{r_1}{r_2}:\, \lambda_1':u_1';\ \CEnd.
  \end{array}
\right) $ is not.
% 



\begin{lemma}
  The state of a projected choreography is uniquely identified by the
  counter $\iota$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}[Projection]\label{thm:epp}
  Given an annotated strongly connected choreography $C$, we have that
  $(S,C) \red{\lambda} (S', C')$ iff
  $\pp_{\role q}\ \proj (\role q, C,\iota)\vdash S_{+} \red{\lambda}
  S_{+}'$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  The proof proceeds by induction on the syntax of $C$.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $C=\interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n}$.  By (the only
    applicable) rule \textsf{(Interact)}, we have that
    % 
    \[
      (S, \interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n})
      \red{\lambda_j} (S[u_j], C_j) 
    \]
    % 
    By definition of projection, we obtain the following PRISM
    commands. Role $\role p$ is projected as:
    \[
      \Big\{\commandBase {a_j} {\ s_{q}\!=\! \iota} {\lambda_j:\ s_{q}\!=\!
        s_{q} +1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k})}\ \&\ \projE
      {u_j}q\Big\}_{j\in J}
      \ \cup\ \bigcup_{j} \proj (\role q, C_j,
      \iota+1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k}))
    \]
    Roles $\role{p_i}$ are projected as:
    \[
      \Big\{\commandBase {a_j} {\ s_{q}\!=\! \iota} {1:\ s_{q}\!=\!
        s_{q} +1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k})}\ \&\ \projE
      {u_j}q\Big\}_{j\in J}
      \ \cup\ \bigcup_{j} \proj (\role q, C_j, \iota+1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k}))
    \]
    %
    while any other role is projected as: 
    \[\bigcup_{j} \proj (\role q, C_j, \iota+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k}))
    \]

  \item $C=\ifTE {E}{p}{C_1}{C_2}$.

  \item $C=X$.

  \item $C=\CEnd$.

  \end{itemize}




  > [Sketch] The proof must be separated into whether we deal with
  rates or probabilities. For Definition~\ref{def:projCTMC}, the proof
  proceeds by induction on the term $C$. For
  $C=\interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n}$, the key case, we
  clearly have that, for any state $S$ there exists $S'$ such that
  $(S,C)\red{\lambda_j}(S',C_j)$. We need to show two things: first,
  that the projection $\pp_\role q\ \proj{(\role{q},C,\iota)}$ of $C$
  can make the same transition; second, that if the projection makes a
  transition, it must be corresponding to that of the choreography
  above.

  We now observe that the state of a generated CTMC is uniquely
  identified by the counter $\iota$.  The uniqueness of the label $a$
  makes sure that all and only those modules involved in this
  interaction synchronise with this action (this shows from the rules
  in Figure~\ref{fig:semantics}).  As a consequence of this and since
  choreographies are strongly connected, the commands generated by
  this step of the translation are such that any state $S_+$ is
  exclusively going to enable these commands (because of the guard
  $s_{\role q}=\iota$) which obviously implies that it must be done
  with rate $\lambda_j$ applying the rules in
  Figure~\ref{fig:semantics}. The same argument can be applied for the
  opposite direction.
  % Note that having a unique label for each step of the choreography
  % is only necessary for recursion. Without recursion, having a
  % unique state identifying this particular step of the choreography
  % would have been sufficient.
  The other cases are similar. The case for DTMC is also similar.



  %       \newpage We prove each direction separately.
  %       \begin{itemize}
  %       \item (only if). Assume that
  %         % 
  %   $$(S, \interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role
  %     p_n})\red{\lambda_j}(S[\sigma(E_j)/x_j], C_j)$$
  %   % 
  %   and let us consider the projection of the term
  %   %
  %   $$\interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n}$$
  %   % 
  %   Given some fresh $l_1,\ldots, l_n$, we generate the following
  %   commands for each $q$ in
  %   $\{\role p, \role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n\}$:
  %   % 
  %   $$
  %   \Big\{\commandBase {l_j} {\ s_{q}\!=\! s} {\kappa_j:\ s_{q}\!=\!
  %     s_{q} +1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k})}\ \&\ \projE
  %   {E_j}q\Big\}_{j\in J}
  %   $$
  %   %
  %   where $\kappa_j=\lambda_j$ if $q\neq\role p$ and $\kappa_j=1$
  %   otherwise. 
  %   % 
  %   Because the labels $l_j$ are fresh and the state counter is unique
  %   to this interaction, these are the only commands that can
  %   synchronise together: this can be shown from the rules defining
  %   the semantics of PRISM. Additionally, since all rates are set to 1
  %   besides the commands generated for role $\role p$, the transition
  %   will also be labelled with $\lambda_j$.


  % \item (if). In the opposite direction, we have that 
  %   % 
  %   $$\proj (*, \interact{p}{\role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n})\vdash
  %   S\uplus S_{+}\red{\lambda} S'\uplus S_{+}'$$
  %   %
  %   Again, given some fresh $l_1,\ldots, l_n$, the projection that
  %   reduces must be such that for each $q$ in
  %   $\{\role p, \role p_1,\ldots,\role p_n\}$:
  %   % 
  %   $$
  %   \Big\{\commandBase {l_j} {\ s_{q}\!=\! s} {\kappa_j:\ s_{q}\!=\!
  %     s_{q} +1+\sum_{k=1}^{j-1}\mathsf{nodes}({C_k})}\ \&\ \projE
  %   {E_j}q\Big\}_{j\in J}
  %   $$
  %   %
  %   where $\kappa_j=\lambda_j$ if $q\neq\role p$ and $\kappa_j=1$
  %   otherwise. 
  %   % 
  %   Again, the freshness of the labels $l_j$ together with the working
  %   states $s_qq$

  %   Because the labels $l_j$ are fresh and the state counter is unique
  %   to this interaction, these are the only commands that can
  %   synchronise together: this can be shown from the rules defining
  %   the semantics of PRISM. Additionally, since all rates are set to 1
  %   besides the commands generated for role $\role p$, the transition
  %   will also be labelled with $\lambda_j$.
