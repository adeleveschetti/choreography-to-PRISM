This is the introduction

- introduce the PRISM language and use a running example.

- argue that these sorts of distributed programs are hard to
understand and it is hard to programme them as intended since we may
miss hidden cases.

- introduce the concept of choreography and show how the example in
PRISM could be rewritten in a more concise way.

- End with a statement that says what this paper is doing.
